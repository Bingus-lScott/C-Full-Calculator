# Cpp-Full-Calculator
 A full calculator project made with a lexer

### Project Goal: 
In the past, I have tried and failed to make my own programming language. See [My programming Language](https://github.com/Bingus-lScott/Scott-Language).
Following this idea, I personally tried to make a calculator to improve my knowledge of interpreters and lexers, which I failed on that too.
Now I'm returning to this idea and plan to make an interpreted calulator where you can type in an expression and possibly define variables
and the computer will solve the equation.

### Sample IO:

Input: 20 * 3 + 2 / 3
Output: 60.6666666667

Input: x = 3, y = 2, x + y
Output: 5

Input: x = 10, y = 3 - 1, 10 * 17 + x^2 / sqrt(9)
Output: 203.3333333333

I get the scope is pretty large for a insignificant programmer such as myself, but I might as well try, right?

### Psuedo Code:
